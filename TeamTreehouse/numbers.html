    ranking section, it would goof up--and I was confused. So instead of understandig the issue, I folded and used the teacher's answer which was to use  correct >= (number greater than the next ranking). --This method I understand.

    // 1. Attach this file -- math.js -- to the index.html file using a <script> tag

    // 3. Create a variable and use the prompt() method to collect a number from a visitor
    var n1 = prompt("Enter a number");

    //    a complete message to print to the document
    //    Start by creating a string that includes <h1> tags as well
    //    and the two input numbers. The string should look something like this:
    //    "<h1>Math  with the numbers 3 and 4</h1>" where the two numbers are
    //    the values input from the user. Use string concatenation to create this

    // 7. Add another string to the message variable. 
    //    The string should look something like this after concatenation:

    //    "3 * 4 = 12"
    //    "3 / 4 = 0.75"
    //    "3 - 4 = -1"

    // 10. Use the document.write() method to print the message variable
